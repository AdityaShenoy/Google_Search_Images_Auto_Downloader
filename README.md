# Google_Search_Images_Auto_Downloader
 This script downloads images from Google Images Search Result using GUI Automation.

The coordinates that are passed in the script are highly specific to my laptop, so if you are running this on your device, make sure you change the code or values as per your device.

The tutorial to write this code is present on my YouTube channel *Brainy Things*
